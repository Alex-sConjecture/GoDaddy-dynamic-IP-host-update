Allows to update machine's dynamic IP with Godady
Following code allows to update dynamic IP adress of your machine with Godaddy DNS, therefore removing the hassle of constantly updating your dynamic IP address. This allows you not rely on free/paid DNS services.
You can use it on Windows or Linux (bin/bash).

For convenience you can package it as a timed execution on Windows, run it in the background or if on Linux, just set cron job. Alternatively you can tune TTL option.
